# Regular expression rail road diagrams for neovim

[![Lint and test](https://github.com/Danie-1/regex-railroad.nvim/actions/workflows/lint-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Danie-1/regex-railroad.nvim/actions/workflows/lint-test.yml/)

This is a plugin for visualising regular expressions using rail road diagrams. 
This plugin is very new. Expect things to change.
Hopefully once I have had some feedback I can stabilise things a bit and start to use semantic versioning.
